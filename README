Interface for 3scale web service API monitoring system

This library provides interface for communication with 3scale monitoring system.

Usage

Include the "lib/ThreeScaleInterface.php" file:

  require_once("/path/to/library/lib/ThreeScaleInterface.php");

Create interface object:

  $interface = new ThreeScaleInterface("http://3scale.net", "your_provider_key");

Because the object is stateless, you can create just one and store it globally.

Then for each request to Your service:

1. Start the transaction with user key and (optionally) estimated resource
usage (in this example it is: 1 hit and 42000 kilobytes of storage space),

  $transaction = $interface->start($user_key, array("hits" => 1, "storage" => 42000));

This will return transaction data (if successful). It is an array containing
these items:

<tt>"id"</tt>::
  transaction id necessary for confirmation or cancellation of transaction
  (see following steps).

<tt>"provider_verification_key"</tt>::
  the provider should send this key back to user so he/she can verify the
  authenticity of the response.

<tt>"contract_name"</tt>::
  name of contract the user is signed for. This can be used to send
  different response according to contract type, if that is desired.

2. Process the request.

2a. If the processing was successful:
Call confirm:

  $interface->confirm($transaction["id"])

Or call it with actual resource usage, if it differs from predicted one:

  $interface->confirm($transaction["id"], array("hits" => 1, "storage" => 40500));

2b. If there was some error, call cancel:

  $interface->cancel($transaction["id"]);

3. Send response back to the user together with provider_verification_key.
